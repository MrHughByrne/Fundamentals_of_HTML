# Fundamentals of HTML 1/5
<p>The purpose of this text file is to store my learnings as I build my knowledge and skills for foundational Web Develpment through Codecademy.

## Introduction to Software Development 

#### Definitions:
* HTTP    =     Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* HTTPS   =     Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
* HTML    =     Hypertext Markup Language
* CSS     =     Cascading Style Sheets (Creates the style and layout of a website)
* SQL     =     Structured Qury Language

#### How Do Browsers Work?
<p>URL -> HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript
<p>1) When a user types in a URL and presses enter, the server processes the request and sends the HTML file back to the client. HTML files hold the content of a website and they also contain links for any additional assets or code that are needed to display the site properly.
<p>2) The browser will begin to search for elements in the HTML file and it will start to make additional HTTP requests for any other external resources used by the HTML file. This often includes:
<p>3) One or more CSS stylesheets. CSS stands for cascading style sheets; CSS creates the style and layout of a web page. The browser will request the CSS stylesheet, and when the server sends it back, the browser analyzes the CSS and starts applying the visual styles to the content of the site.
<p>4) The request-response cycle also sends website assets, like images and videos, from the server to the browser. If these files are large, there might even be a noticeable delay before they are rendered by the browser.
<p>5) One or more JavaScript files. JavaScript makes the webpage interactive. This programming language functions as the “behavior” of the web page. A webpage that does not use JavaScript is known as a static webpage.

### What is Web Development?
* HTML - structures website content
* CSS - applies styling to websites
* JavaScript - adds interactivity to websites
* SQL - allows your web application to store and retreive data

#### Adding Hypelinks
href = **H**yper **Ref**erence
<p> When we set the href property on an anchor tag (abbreviated to <a>) we can specify both the text that should be rendered for the user (the text within the anchor tag) and the URL that the browser should navigate to.

### What is CSS?
<p>CSS - applies styling to websites

***
### What is JavaScript?
<p>JavaScript - adds interactivity to websites
- Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused over and over.
- Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behaviours, like the user hovering their mouse oer an HTML element or resizing a window
- When an event is fired, a function is executed.

***
### What is SQL
<p>SQL - allows your web application to store and retreive data
<p>SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns.

## Programming Vs Coding
* Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer)
* Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand
