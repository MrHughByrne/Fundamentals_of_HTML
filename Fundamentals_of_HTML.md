# HTML Elements
<p>HTML is made up of elements
<p> General makeup of a HTML element:



<p>A commonly used tag is the body tag. 
<p>This is represented by an opening tag: < body > and a closing tag < /body >
<p> Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen.

###

####HTML Structure
<p> A child element is when one element is contained inside another, for example a < p > tag inside the < body > tag



####HTML Headers
<p>In HTML, there are six different headings, or heading elements.
+< h1 > = Main Heading
+< h2 > = Sub Heading
+< h3 >
+< h4 >
+< h5 >
+< h6 >
<p> These headings have to be used with an escape tag e.g. < /h1>

###

####HTML Div
<p>One of the most popular elements in HTML is the < div > element. < div > is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections.



<p>Divs don't have any distinguishing visual feature but are useful for when you want to apply different formats to sections on your page

###

####HTML Attributes
<p>If we want to expand an element’s tag, we can do so using an attribute. 
<p>Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling. 
<p>Attributes are made up of the following two parts:

+The name of the attribute
+The value of the attribute
<p>
The id attribute is used to specify differences between elements for example, different Div elements

###

#####Displaying Text
<p> in order to display text on a page you use 'paragraph' or 'span'
+Paragraphs (< p >) contain a block of plain text.
+< span > contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.
<p>
<p>t’s best to use a < span > element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text.



###

####Styling Text
<p> For italics use < em >
<p> For bold use < strong >



###

####Line Breaks
<p>In order to create a line break, use < br >. There is no need to use a closing tag with this element.
<p>These can be doubled up in order to create multiple consecutive line breaks

###

#####Lists
<p> < ul > is used to create an Unordered List
<p>This list is **bulleted**
<p> < li > is used to add items that list (this must be a child to the < ul > list



<p> < ol > is used to create an Ordered List
<p>This list is **numbered**
<p> the same < li > element as unordered lists is used to enter elements into it.



###

####Images
<p>In order to add an image use the following syntax:
<p>< img scr="URL" />



<p> To add a tag to your image use the "alt" attribute:



###

####Videos
<p>Videos are similar to images however a video element **requires a closing tag**
<p>"width" and "height" are also required elements
<p>"controls" is used to tell the browser to include basic stop/start video controls
<p>Lastly, text can be included between the tags to show if the video is unable to load



###

##HTML: Structure
####Document Type Declaration
<p>In order to tell the browser that you are using HTML, you need to start with a document type declaration:



<p> Next, in order to create HTML structure and content you need to create a HTML open and closing tag:



####Head Element
<p>The < head > element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page.
